- I noticed that two letters of the types generated in frames.ts is missing. Not for everyone of course.
- I am also left wondering what was the state with the tiles layers vs the normal layers. I think I got pissed on them, but I don't know if I should use them or not. I think the bad part was Tiled not being able to process them anyway, so I gave up on it.

Yeah, it's a add-only system, not sure how bad it will get, but only adding layers right now into the prototype and reading it back. Add a sprite and play with it.
